                    <p>It consists of a long tunic worn over pants, generally reaching the lower leg area. The tunic has high slits on both sides that start from the waist. </p>
                    
                    <p>The áo dài is often made from silk, cotton, or other fabrics.

It is also embroidered with beads, patterns and motifs.</p>
                    
                    Its design is a symbol of both beauty and tradition in Vietnamese culture.
